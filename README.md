# Set Up Baseline Grid

Script for searching text and testing GREP expressions in Adobe InDesign. The matches are highlighted in the document.

## Please notice

Locked layers and objects are not searched.
    
## Hints 

At running the script a new condition (Conditional Text) is created. It's called `::Highlight_GREP::`. The script applied them to GREP expressions matches. After completion of the script, the condition is normally removed.

If, for whatever reason, the condition is still existing after using the script, you could open the Conditional Text panel (Window > Type and Tables > Conditional Text) and delete it.

## Project Octopus

The script is also part of the [Octopus project](https://www.project-octopus.net/script-setup-baselinescript/)
